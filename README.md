# `ltx-talk` - A LaTeX class for producing presentations

## NOTICE

This is a *development draft*: the exact nature of what might be released,
including almost all features and the name the class, is still open.

## Description

The `ltx-talk` class is focused on producing (on-screen) presentations, along
with support material such as handouts and speaker notes. Content is created in
a `frame` environment, each of which can be divided up into a number of slides
(actual output pages). A simple 'overlay' notation is used to specify which
material appears on each slide within a frame. The class supports a range of
environments to enable complex slide relationships to be constructed.

The appearance of slides is controlled by a template system. Many of the
elements of slides can be adjusted by setting simple key-based values in the
preamble. More complex changes can be implemented by altering specific,
targeted definitions without needing to rewrite entire blocks of code. This
allows a variety of visual appearances to be selected for the same content
source.
